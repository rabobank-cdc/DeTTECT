  # - Note that detection and visibility are independent from each other.
  #   Meaning that detection could be left blank and only have visibility filled in.
  # - Also note that the below serves purely as an example and is therefore not accurate on all areas.
  #
  # - If desired you are free to add any key-value pairs. This will not impact the functionality of the tool.
